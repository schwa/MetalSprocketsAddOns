## 1: Replace histogram image comparison with GoldenImage package
status: new
priority: medium
kind: none
created: 2026-01-17T00:00:00Z

The test Support.swift uses a homebrew histogram-based image comparison (vImage, CoreImage, Histogram struct). Replace this with the GoldenImage package which provides PSNR-based comparison. Requires publishing GoldenImage to GitHub first, then adding it as a dependency.

## 2: Remove local cross-environment macros and adopt them from MetalSprockets

Once MetalSprockets#305 is complete, remove the locally defined cross-environment macros from `Sources/MetalSprocketsAddOnsShaders/include/Support.h` (TEXTURE2D, DEPTH2D, TEXTURECUBE, SAMPLER, BUFFER, ATTRIBUTE, MS_ENUM) and import them from MetalSprockets instead.

Blocked on MetalSprockets#305.

## 3: Demo views render with wrong size/aspect ratio on initial load
status: new
priority: medium
kind: bug
created: 2026-04-13T05:04:24Z

RenderView-based demos (Spinning Cube, GraphicsContext3D) render with incorrect aspect ratio or empty content on first load. Requires window resize or navigating away and back to fix. Likely caused by RenderView receiving a stale/zero drawable size before the NavigationSplitView detail column finishes layout. May be a DemoKit or MetalSprockets RenderView issue.

## 4: GraphicsContext3D fill renders as white instead of specified color
status: new
priority: medium
kind: bug
created: 2026-04-13T05:07:02Z

Fill geometry in GraphicsContext3D renders as white when using fractional alpha (e.g. opacity 0.3). With full opacity the color is correct. The fill render pipeline has no blending enabled — alpha values are written to the framebuffer but don't affect compositing, resulting in near-white output for low-alpha fills. Need to enable alpha blending via renderPipelineDescriptorModifier on the fill pipeline.

## 5: GraphicsContext3D fill projection hardcoded to XY plane — fails for XZ/YZ geometry
status: new
priority: medium
kind: bug
created: 2026-04-13T05:08:59Z

generateFillGeometry() projects 3D points onto XY (drops Z) for earcut triangulation. This produces degenerate geometry for paths on the XZ or YZ planes (e.g. the star on the ground plane at y=0 — all points project to a line). Should detect the dominant plane or use the path's normal to choose the projection axis.
